## About Node.js

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript on the server-side to build scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

## Key Features

- **Asynchronous and Event-Driven**: All APIs of Node.js library are asynchronous, meaning they are non-blocking.
- **Very Fast**: Node.js is built on the V8 JavaScript Engine of Google Chrome which makes its library very fast in code execution.
- **Single-Threaded but Highly Scalable**: Node.js uses a single-threaded model with event looping.
- **No Buffering**: Node.js applications never buffer any data. These applications simply output the data in chunks.
